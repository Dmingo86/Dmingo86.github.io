   <h1>Beautiful 2007 GSXR-1000</h1>
    <h3><Strong>Own The Racetrack</Strong></h3>
	<p>Open-class sportbikes are the showcase models that manufacturers like to brag about. 
	After all, they are the thoroughbreds of each company's line. Suzuki is no different; 
	its GSX-R1000 since its inception seven years ago has gone by one motto: “Own The Racetrack.” 
	The Suzuki has been in the hunt in recent Cycle World shootouts, but the brute power of Kawasaki's ZX-10R has pummeled it into submission two years running.</p>
  <h4>Last of a dying breed</h4>
